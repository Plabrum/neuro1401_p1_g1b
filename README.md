# Cognitive Neuroscience 1401 Project 1 Group 1b

**Prompt:**

Group 1: Project 1

1. Implement Foldiak’s (1991) learning rule and demonstrate how it learns a representation that is invariant to translation. Compare to the standard Hebbian learning rule.
2. What happens when the model is exposed to other kinds of transformations (e.g., rotations, changes in scale)?
3. Show (and interpret) what’s going on inside the model over the course of learning: inputs, outputs, traces, synaptic weights.
4. Discuss how the model relates to existing empirical data. Some example references are: Wallis & Bulthoff (2001) and Li & DiCarlo (2008).
